Each time your custom design code is synced to Kinde, a new deployment is created. A deployment is a unique point in time process that checks the code, which can then be made live. 

## Turn off the auto go live function

To fully manage deployments and control which ones go live, switch off the auto-go-live function. 

In **Settings > Git repo**, switch off the **Set synced code live immediately** option**.**

## Sync code

Every time you change your code in GitHub, you must sync those changes back to Kinde so you can make them live.

1. Go to **Design > Custom code**.
2. Select **Sync code**. A new deployment is generated on click. If the deployment is successful, you will be able to make it live.

## Make a deployment live

1. Go to **Design > Custom code**. The **Summary** page shows which deployment is live and which is ready to go.
2. If you want, select **Sync code** to get the latest deployment.
3. Select **Deployments** in the menu. A list of current and previous deployments is shown. 
4. Find the deployment you want to make live and select **Make live** in the three dots menu.

## Roll back a deployment

1. Go to **Design > Custom code**. The **Summary** page shows which deployment is live and which is ready to go.
2. Select **Deployments** in the menu. A list of current and previous deployments is shown. 
3. Find the previous deployment you want to roll back to and select **Make live** in the three dots menu.
