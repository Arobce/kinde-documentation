Here’s how translation is handled when you change page content.

### Language detection

Language detection is automatically handled for you and Kinde gives display priority to languages as follows:

1. The language supplied in the auth url ^
2. The preferred language selected in the user’s browser ^
3. The default language you have selected in Kinde

^ If you have chosen not to support a language, we will try the next available option.

Through language matching, Kinde automatically works out the closest 
base language to the requested language and will use this if supported 
by your app.

After the priority list outlined above Kinde will fall back to US English as a last resort, if a translation is not available.

### Widget translations

Translations inside of the Kinde widget are taken care of by Kinde. We will grab the copy from the relevant route and language from your `Page content` settings inside of Kinde and apply them to the widget. 

### Page translations

Kinde provides relevant localized content within the `context` object that is passed into the Page default function as mentioned above. Localizations and placeholder replacements are handled for you at run time. 

**Example usage**

```jsx
const {content} = event.context.widget;

<img src={<img_url>} alt={content.logoAlt} />

<title>{content.pageTitle}</title>

<h1>{content.heading}</h1>

<p>{content.description}</p>
```
