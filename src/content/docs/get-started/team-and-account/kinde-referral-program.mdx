Kinde's referral program rewards existing businesses for referring new business to Kinde. 

Referring a friend could earn you 20% of what they pay us if they join up. They also get a $50 credit. 

## How it works

- Grab your personal referral code (see below)
- Share it with a friend or colleague
- They sign up using the link and thatâ€™s it!

## Get your referral code

1. Sign in to Kinde, click on your profile picture, and select **Account details**.
2. scroll down the page until you see the referral section.
3. Generate your unique code (you only need to do this once).
4. Copy the code and re-use it to refer as many friends as you want.

Visit our [website](https://kinde.com/refer/) for more information about the referral program.

# How to use the code
- Share directly with friends and colleagues
- Explain they must sign up via the referral link. We can't honor verbal referrals or referrals who sign up via our normal sign up page.
