Workflows rely on your code being available to execute when the trigger event happens. When you update your code, you need to update the related workflow in Kinde. 

## Sync code from your repo

Get the latest code from your repo so that it can be checked for deployment-readiness. The result of a sync will tell you if the code is ready.

1. Go to **Workflows**.
2. Select **Sync code**. This will update all workflows with any new code. The latest deployment shows on the **Summary** page for each workflow.

## Make a deployment live

Typically, you will make the latest code deployment live, so it is used in the workflow. But you can make any deployment live.

1. Go to **Workflows**.
2. Refresh code from your repo by selecting **Get latest code**.
3. Select the workflow you want to update.
4. On the **Workflow** page, select **Make live** from the deployment context menu. The workflow will update to use the latest code.

## View all deployments

1. Go to **Workflows**. 
2. Select the workflow to view the details.
3. Select **Deployments** in the menu. A list of all your deployments shows. See below to interpret deployment statuses.

## Deployment status

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Live | The code version currently live and ready to use in a workflow |
| Deployed | Code that you have committed in your repo and has been checked for validity in Kinde and is ready to run in the workflow. |
| Failed | Code that you have committed in your repo and has been found not be valid to run in Kinde. |
| Deactivated | Code that was live and has now been deactivated. It is possible for it to be made live again. |
| Processing | You may occasionally see one of these. They indicate transitional states before a definitive status is achieved. |
| Draft | New workflow without a live deployment. |
