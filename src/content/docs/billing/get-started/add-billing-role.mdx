Skip this step if you sell your services to individuals (B2C).

If you are a B2B business, when someone signs up to your service via Kinde auth, an organization is created in your Kinde business. That someone also becomes the account creator, and they need permissions to buy plans and manage payments on behalf of their organization. 

Before you start selling to your business customers, create a default billing role to assign to the account creator when they sign up.

1. Go to **Settings > Roles** and select **Add role**. The **Add role** window opens.
    
    ![Roles screen for billing owner](https://imagedelivery.net/skPPZTHzSlcslvHjesZQcQ/96415552-a11b-4be3-e644-d9eaa2af6700/public)
    
2. Name the role, for example, `Billing contact` , and enter a description and **Key**.
3. Select the **Assign to the creator** option.
4. In the **System permissions** section, ensure the **org:write:billing** system permission is selected.
    
This role will now be automatically assigned to users who create an organization as part of the authentication flow.
