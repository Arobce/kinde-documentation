If you want to include additional information in tokens, you can customize access tokens, M2M tokens, and ID tokens using preset custom claims. If you need Kinde token formats to be third-party friendly, you can also enable mapping for those services, e.g. Hasura.

Token customization is a step toward enabling custom claims, but it is not the same thing.

## Add claims to a token

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications** and select **Details** on your application.
2. Select **Tokens**, then scroll to the **Token customization** section.
3. On the relevant token type card, select **Customize**. A selection window appears.

4. Select the available **Additional claims** and **Properties** you want to include in the token.
5. Select **Save**.

## Additional claims for tokens
Apart from your own [custom properties](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/), you can add some out of the box additional claims to tokens.

### Add claims to access tokens

You can:
- add an organization name to an access token
- add roles to an access token
- add an email to an access token
- add an external organization ID to an access token

### Add claims to ID tokens

You can:
- Add a user's social identity to an ID token
- Add a user's organizations to an ID token

### Add claims to M2M tokens

You can add feature flags to an M2M token.

## Token integration for third parties

Currently, we only support formatting for Hasura.

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Applications** and select **Details** on your application.
2. Select **Tokens.**
3. Scroll to the **Token integrations** section and switch the toggle on for the platform you use.
4. Select **Save**.
