We want you to keep control of your own code, in your own repo, so you can update and commit as usual. Then sync your code with one click and itâ€™s ready to use.

You first need to set up your repo and connect the branch to Kinde. 

## Set up your repo

For the code sync to work, your workflow files need to be stored in a specific place in your repo.

1. In the root of the repo create a file called `kinde.json` with the content 
    
    ```jsx
    {
      "rootDir": "kindeSrc" // This is root folder Kinde will use to discover workflows.
    }
    ```
    
2. In your repo, create this folder structure in your root directory: `[RootFolder]/environment/workflows`. This is where you will add the files that Kinde will read.

## Connect your repo and branch

We currently only support GitHub but will offer other git providers soon.

1. In Kinde, go to **Workflows**.
2. Select **Connect repo**.
3. Follow the sign-in prompts from your git service.
4. Select the repo and select **Next**.
5. Select the branch and select **Save**. You will know the connection is successful when you see the connected repo panel at the top of the screen. 
6. Check if your code has synced to Kinde. Go to **Home > Workflows**. If you already have workflow files set up, the workflows will appear in **Workflows** page. If we failed to read your workflow code, you should see a warning.

7. Review any issues in the **Sync log**. 
8. You can re-sync the code at anytime by selecting **Sync code**.
