You can’t yet create a workflow from scratch in Kinde. You can only use the triggers provided (for now) and add workflow code to your repo, that can be executed when the trigger fires.

Workflows only show up in Kinde if you have connected your repo and there are valid workflow files found in the branch you select. 

## Add a workflow file to your repo

1. In the Kinde infrastructure folder, you set up (e.g. `[RootFolder]/environment/`) create a TypeScript file. You can name it anything ending in `Workflow.ts`. 
    
    For example if the Kinde workflow name is `Custom-access-token` , the filename could be `CustomAccessTokenWorkflow.ts.`
    
2. Enter your code into the file in javascript or typescript. For details on what must be included, see the [kinde/infrastructure readme file in Github](https://github.com/kinde-oss/infrastructure).
3. When you commit code in your repo and then sync the code in Kinde, we will perform validity tests on the files. If the commit is valid, it will have the status of ‘Draft’ in Kinde.

## Make the workflow live
