If you want your customers (organizations or individual users) to manage their own plans, including upgrades and downgrades, payment information, team members, etc., set up the self-service portal to allow this. 

Aside from account management, the self-serve portal is for orgs to self-manage teams and business information, and individuals to manage their user profile.
