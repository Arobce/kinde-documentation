You can configure a self-serve portal to enable users to be able to self-manage functions provided by Kinde. For example, you can allow them to update their profile, as well as their billing subscription and payment details (if you have billing set up).

A self-serve portal means your customers can make basic account changes without contacting you for support. This can save time and money.

## Configure the user self-serve portal

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Self-serve portal**.
2. Enter the **Return URL** that you want users to land on when they exit the portal, e.g. your app dashboard.
4. In the **User profile** section, select the functions you want the user to be able to manage. If you select **Billing**, they can manage their plan as well as payment methods.
5. Select **Save**.

## Generate the self-serve portal link

Access to the portal is granted via a one-time link. There are two main ways to generate this link:

- **Using the user's access token** (recommended)
- **Using the Kinde Management API**

### Include the self-serve portal link in the user's access token

This method is ideal when you want to generate the portal link on the fly—for example, when a user clicks an "Account" button in your app.

### Generate a self-serve portal link with a Kinde SDK

If you're using the Kinde React SDK, you can use the `<PortalLink />` component, which both generates the link and redirects the user:

```jsx
import {PortalLink} from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-react";

<PortalLink>Account</PortalLink>;
```

### Generate a self-serve portal link without a Kinde SDK

If you're not using a Kinde SDK, you can manually call the Account API:

```js
const response = await fetch("/api/v1/account_api/portal_link", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${userAccessToken}`
  }
});
const data = await response.json();
window.location = data.url;
```

Optional parameters:

- `return_url` – where to redirect the user after exiting the portal.
- `sub_nav` – specify the portal section to open (e.g., `organization_billing`, `profile`).

### Manage the self-serve portal link using the Kinde Management API

This option is useful for server-side applications or if you're using Kinde billing features without Kinde Authentication.

Make a request to the `POST /api/v1/portal/generate_url` endpoint using an M2M token.

**Request body**

```js
{
  "user_id": "kp_1234567890", // The ID of the user for whom you want to generate the portal link
  "organization_code": "org_123456789", // Optional: the organization code for which the portal link is generated
  "return_url": "https://yourapp.com/dashboard", // Optional: where to redirect the user after exiting the portal
  "sub_nav": "profile" // Optional: specify the portal section to open (e.g., `organization_billing`, `profile`)
}
```

This will return a one-time portal link for the specified user.
