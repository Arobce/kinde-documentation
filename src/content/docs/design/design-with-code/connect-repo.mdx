To enable your custom code to override Kinde page design, you need to set up and connect a git repo for the design files. You must also be using a [custom domain](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/) to run your custom code with Kinde.

## Connect your repo

1. Go to **Design > Custom code**.
2. Select the option to **Connect repo**. This will take you to the **Settings > Git Repo** page where you can manage your repo connection for design and workflows.
3. If you don’t already have a repo set up for workflows, select **Connect GitHub**. 
4. Follow the prompts to choose a repo and branch. 
5. Once connected, choose if you want to **set synced code live immediately**. This is more efficient for dev and testing environments, but you might switch this off in your production environment.

## Set up the Git directory structure

Your directory structure should follow the following structure.

```jsx
myApp/
  ├── kindeSrc/
  │   └── environment/
  │       └── pages/
  │           └── (kinde)/
  │               └── <route>/
  │                   └── page.tsx
  ├── package.json
  └── kinde.json
```

In the above example, `<route>` is used to map your code to a rendered page in Kinde. For example `kindeSrc/environment/pages/(kinde)/(register)/page.tsx` will map to the register / sign up page in the authentication flow.
