Marketing analytics relies on data about customer behaviour. This can include how a customer finds you, e.g. through a campaign, and what a customer does when they interact. Kinde allows you to pass UTM data in tokens, and store it as [properties](/properties/about-properties/) in Kinde. From here, you can extrapolate campaign success and other metrics you wish to track.

## Set up properties in Kinde

- [Set up the properties in Kinde](/properties/about-properties/)
- [Add properties to tokens](/properties/work-with-properties/properties-in-tokens/)

## Update your application to pass marketing codes

Wherever you have a campaign, button, or interaction that you want to track, add the property key and unique code so it is picked up and added to Kinde when the user interacts.
