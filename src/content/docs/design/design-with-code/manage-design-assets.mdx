It is likely that your logos and favicons are hosted on Kinde, but you may also manage extrernally hosted assets. Here's how assets are referenced in design code.

## Favicons

The Kinde infrastructure package ships with helper methods for accessing these:

```jsx
import {
	getFallbackFaviconUrl,
  getSVGFaviconUrl,
} from "@kinde/infrastructure";
```

### Usage

```jsx
<link rel="icon" href={getFallbackFaviconUrl()} sizes="48x48">
<link rel="icon" href={getSVGFavicon()} type="image/svg+xml" />
```

## Logos

The Kinde infrastructure package ships with helper methods for accessing these:

```jsx
import {
	getLogoUrl,
  getDarkModeLogoUrl,
} from "@kinde/infrastructure";
```

### Usage

```jsx
// Always use light logo
<img
	src={getLogoUrl()}
	alt={event.context.widget.content.logoAlt}
/>

// Always use dark logo
<img
	src={getDarkModeLogoUrl()}
	alt={event.context.widget.content.logoAlt}
/>

// User preference
<picture>
	<source
		media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
		srcset={getDarkModeLogoUrl()}
	>
	<img
		src={getLogoUrl()}
		alt={event.context.widget.content.logoAlt}
	/>
</picture>
```

## Org logos

Both functions accept the org code as an argument to return the relevant organization logo url:

```jsx
// Org logos
// Pass org code in
const {orgCode} = event.request.authUrlParams
<img
	src={getLogoUrl(orgCode)}
	alt={event.context.widget.content.logoAlt}
/>
```

## Storing externally-hosted assets

We know you will want to use assets like fonts and images stored outside of Kinde. Our strict CSP which we have for security, can make calling external sources somewhat trickier, but with good reason.

Your root domain as well as any subdomains of that domain are added to our CSP by default so to use your own assets and comply with Kindeâ€™s CSP, the assets should be stored on servers that share the same domain as your custom domain. 

For example, if you are using the custom domain [`auth.myapp.com`](http://auth.myapp.com) you could host fonts/images/css at [`https://assets.myapp.com`](https://assets.myapp.com) and they would be accessible in your code.
