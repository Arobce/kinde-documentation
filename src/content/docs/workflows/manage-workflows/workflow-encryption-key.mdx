You can generate encryption keys to use in your workflows. Encryption keys protect sensitive data and should be updated regularly for continued protection. In Kinde, they are unique to each workflow.

## How encryption keys work

When an API call is made when a workflow runs, the body is automatically encrypted with the active encryption key for the workflow. Use the same encryption key in your own code to decrypt the payload on arrival. This ensures secure transfer of the data. 

## Add an encryption key to a workflow

1. Go to **Workflows** and select a workflow. 
2. Select **Encryption keys** in the menu.
3. Select **Add encryption key**. A dialog appears, enabling you to copy the key. You need to copy it immediately, as it cannot be viewed again. 
4. After you copy the key, select **Close**. If this is the fist key you have added, it will automatically be made **active**.
5. Add the key to your code, to decrypt data sent from Kinde.

## Update an encryption key

1. Go to **Workflows** and select a workflow. 
2. Select **Encryption keys** in the menu.
3. Select **Add encryption key**. A dialog opens with information about adding the key.
4. Select **Add**. A dialog appears showing the key value.
5. Copy the key value and store it somewhere you can access again.
6. Select **Close**.
7. When you are ready to update the key in your code, select the three dots menu on the new key, then select **Activate**.  A dialog opens, confirming the action.
8. Select **Activate encryption key**. This makes the new key active and deactivates the previously active key.
9. Add the new key value to your code, to continue decrypting data sent from Kinde.

## Deactivate/activate an encryption key

You can change the active status of any key. 

1. Go to **Workflows** and select a workflow. 
2. Select **Encryption keys** in the menu.
3. To deactivate an active key:
    1. Select the three dots menu.
    2. Select **Deactivate**. A confirmation window opens.
    3. Follow the prompts and select **Deactivate encryption key.**
4. To activate a deactivated key:
    1. Select the three dots menu.
    2. Select **Activate**. A confirmation window opens.
    3. Follow the prompts and select **Activate encryption key**. This makes the new key active and deactivates any previously active key.

## Delete used or unwanted encryption keys

Deleting an active key can break your code. Only delete inactive keys.

1. Go to **Workflows** and select a workflow. 
2. Select **Encryption keys** in the menu.
3. Next to an inactive key, select the three dots menu.
4. Select **Delete key**. A confirmation window opens.
5. Follow the prompts and select **Delete encryption key**.
