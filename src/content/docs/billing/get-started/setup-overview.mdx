Billing is big step for a business, so it’s a good idea to review the process before you start.

## Overview of billing setup

1. Set up billing roles and permissions (B2B)
2. Set currency - you can’t change this once plans are published
3. Connect to Stripe
4. Build plans
5. Publish plans
6. Enable subscription self-serve (optional)
    1. Create a plan selector
    2. Enable self-serve portal
7. Update your code
8. Test the setup and get your first subscriber!

## ⚠️ Test in a non-production environment

If you are using billing for the first time, make sure you use a Kinde non-production environment to test out the billing features. 

When you use a non-production environment, Stripe automatically creates a test Stripe environment. This test environment allows you to create customers and billing subscriptions without actually charging customers. You can also use Stripe’s test credit card details.

## Before setting up billing

- Make a list of all your app’s features - with names, descriptions, prices, metered rates, limits, inclusions, etc. You might consider doing this in a spreadsheet to make it easier and faster to add features in the Kinde plan builder. Include plan variations for prices, limits, etc.

- (B2B) make sure your Kinde business is set up to [create an organization on sign up](https://docs.kinde.com/build/organizations/orgs-for-developers/#new-organization-self-sign-up).

Follow the numbered steps in this section to set up billing in your business.
