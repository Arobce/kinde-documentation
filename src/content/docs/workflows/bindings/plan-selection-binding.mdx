The `kinde.planSelection` binding provides methods to use when a plan selection is made.

## Methods

### `deny(reason: string): void`

Prevent the user from changing their plan.

## Available in workflows

- [user:plan_selection](/workflows/example-workflows/plan-selection-workflow/)

## Configuration

```js
export const workflowSettings = {
  // ...other settings
  bindings: {"kinde.planSelection": {}}
};
```

## Usage

### Using the Kinde infrastructure library (recommended)

The [Kinde infrastructure library](https://github.com/kinde-oss/infrastructure) provides a type-safe helper:

```js
import { denyPlanSelection } from "@kinde/infrastructure";

export default async function (event: onplanSelectionedEvent) {
  if (!canCancelPlan()) {
    denyPlanSelection("You are not allowed to change your plan as you have outstanding payments");
  }
}
```

### Using the low-level API

If you're not using the infrastructure library, you can call the underlying API directly:

```js
kinde.planSelection.deny(
  "You are not allowed to change your plan as you have outstanding payments"
);
```
