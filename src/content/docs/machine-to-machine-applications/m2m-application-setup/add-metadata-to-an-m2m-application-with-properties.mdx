You can use **Properties** in Kinde to add structured metadata to a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) application. These properties can store configuration or contextual data like `region`, `tier`, or `model_version`.

This is useful for:
- Customizing tokens
- Driving logic in downstream systems
- Managing AI agent behavior

If you're looking to include properties inside tokens, see [Customize the contents of an M2M token](/machine-to-machine-applications/m2m-token-customization/).

## Step 1 - Define your property

Before you can assign a property to an app, you need to define it.

1. In Kinde, go to **Properties**
2. Select **Add property**
3. Choose the object type: **Application**
4. Give the property a name (e.g. `tier`, `region`, `model_version`)
5. Add a description and data type (optional)
6. You can opt for whether a property is allowed to be included in tokens (optional)
7. Select **Save**

Once saved, this property is now available across all M2M applications.

## Step 2 - Assign the property to an M2M application

1. In Kinde, go to **Applications > M2M apps**
2. Select the app you want to assign metadata to
3. Open the **Properties** tab
4. Add or edit values for the available fields

For example:

| Property        | Value     |
|----------------|-----------|
| region          | eu        |
| model_version   | v2        |
| tier            | pro       |

These values are stored with the app but are not included in tokens unless explicitly enabled.

## Include a property in an M2M token

1. Go to **Applications > Your M2M app**
2. Select the **Tokens** tab
3. Under **Properties**, toggle on the properties you want included in the token

These flags will be embedded in the token under the `application_properties` claim:

```json
{
"application_properties": {
    "region": {
      "v": "eu"
    },
    "tier": {
      "v": "pro"
    }
  }
}
```

## Note

- Properties are available for applications, users, and organizations
- Only **Application** properties are relevant for M2M apps
- This feature is useful for setting up per-customer configuration without hardcoding or external storage
