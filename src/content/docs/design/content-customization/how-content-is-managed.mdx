You can change the content for the main pages that your users see as part of authentication. Youâ€™re also able to manage the content in [all the languages you have selected](/design/pages/internationalization/) in Kinde.

Currently, you can edit content for the following pages:

- Sign up
- Sign-up confirmation

Additional screens will be added, including error screens, in the coming months.

- Sign-up page: General page elements, consent, disclaimer, privacy, T&C acceptance, some error messages
- Sign-in page: General page elements plus 'Account not found' error message

For the confirmation and request access form pages, you can edit the general page elements.
