Trigger: `user:new_password_provided`

This trigger fires after a new password is entered in either the sign-up flow or the reset password flow.

## Security considerations

Security is at the heart of our technical decisions at Kinde, and keeping user passwords safe is a huge part of this. Therefore:

- Any attempt to log the password out to the console in this workflow will be redacted
- API calls can only be made from these workflows using the Kinde provided `secureFetch` method which secures the payload with an encryption key

## Example use cases

### Custom password strength policy

As a baseline, Kinde runs the following password checks:

- A password is supplied
- The password is at least 8 characters long
- The password does not exist in the 1,000,000 most common passwords

With this workflow you can add your own custom code to run additional checks, for example if your business requires a specific mix of upper / lower case characters, or inclusion of special characters.

### Sync password with an external system

For gradual migrations to Kinde where several apps are in play (e.g. a mobile application and a web application), you might want to migrate web users first and mobile app users later. If users have access to both applications, then password resets on the web application would not be persisted to the legacy mobile app password store.

With this workflow you can securely send the password to your mobile app system in order to keep them in sync.

## Workflow code

### The event object

The main argument provided to your code is the Kinde workflow `event` object which has two keys `request` and `context`. This gives you access to the reason the workflow was triggered. Here's an example:

```jsx
{
	"request": {},
	"context": {
		"domains": {
			"kindeDomain": "https://example.kinde.com" // Your Kinde domain
		},
		"auth": {
			"firstPassword": "someSecurePassword", // the first password entered
			"secondPassword": "someSecurePassword", // password match field
			"newPasswordReason": "reset" | "initial" // whether it is registration or reset
		}
		"user": {
				"id": "kp_1234566" // only provided in password reset flows as otherwise new user
				"email": "hello@example.com" // the email provided
		}
}
```

### Workflow settings

```jsx
export const workflowSettings = {
  id: "passwordReset",
  name: "Reset password",
  failurePolicy: {
    action: "stop"
  },
  trigger: "user:new_password_provided",
  bindings: {
    "kinde.secureFetch": {}, // Required for external API calls
    "kinde.widget": {} // Required to invalidate the form
  }
};
```

### Secure fetch binding

When an API call is made using `kinde.secureFetch()` the body is automatically encrypted with the active encryption key for the workflow. This can be generated under **Workflow > Encryption keys**.

You will need to use the same encryption key in your own code to decrypt the payload on arrival. This ensures secure transfer of the password.

We handle the encryption for you so your code might look like:

### Widget binding

The `kinde.widget` binding gives you access to the Kinde widget which is the central form on the page. In this case the form with the two password fields.

It exposes a method for invalidating a form field `invalidateFormField`.

```jsx
kinde.widget.invalidateFormField(fieldName, message);
```

Example

```jsx
const isMinCharacters = context.auth.firstPassword.length >= 50;

kinde.widget.invalidateFormField(
  "p_first_password",
  "Provide a password at least 50 characters long"
);
```

The field names for this workflow are

| Field name     | Description                                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p_first_password` | The first password field                                                                 |
| `p_second_password` | The second password field, typically to check it matches the first to help prevent typos |
