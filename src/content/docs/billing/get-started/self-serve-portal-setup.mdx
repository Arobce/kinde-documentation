If you want your customers (organizations or individual users) to manage their own plans, including upgrades and downgrades, payment information, team members, etc., set up the self-service portal to allow this. 

Aside from account management, the self serve portal is for orgs to self manage teams and business information, and individuals to manage their user profile.

See [Self-serve portal](/build/set-up-options/self-serve-portal-for-orgs/) for information on setting it up.
