To use workflows and other BYO code features, you need to sync your git-stored code to Kinde. Currently, Kinde only syncs with Github, but other providers will be added as the features progress.

## Sync your git repo

1. Go to **Settings > Git repo**.
2. Select **Add repo** or **Change repo**
3. Follow the steps to add your repo, select the branch, etc.
4. If this is a non-production environment, consider selecting the **Set synched code live immediately** option.
5. Select **Save**.

1. Go to **Settings > Git repo**.
2. Select the **Set synced code live immediately** option.
5. Select **Save**.
