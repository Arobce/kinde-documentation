Here's the process for connecting to the Kinde Management API.

## Step 1: Add a machine to machine application

1. Go to **Settings > Applications**.
2. Select **Add Application**.
3. In the dialog that opens, give the application a name, and select **Machine to Machine** as the **Application type**.
4. Select **Save**. App keys - including Domain details, Client ID and Client Secret - are issued for the application. 
5. Copy the app keys. You need these details to test or initiate access requests from your application or service to Kinde's API. See Step 3 below.

## Step 2: Authorize the M2M application and select scopes

We recommend adding as few scopes as you need, to maintain API security. Learn more about [scopes](

1. Select **View details** on the M2M application you just created. 
2. On the left, select **APIs**.
3. Select the three dots next to the Kinde management API, then choose **Authorize application**.
4. Select the three dots next to the Kinde management API, then choose **Manage scopes**. 
5. Select the scopes you want to include in the token. For maximum security only enable the minimum scopes you require. 
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Make an access token request

- [Get access token using Postman](/developer-tools/kinde-api/access-token-for-api/)
- [Test endpoints using Postman](/developer-tools/kinde-api/access-token-for-api/)
- [Call the Kinde API Node.js (example)](/developer-tools/kinde-api/api-example-node/)
