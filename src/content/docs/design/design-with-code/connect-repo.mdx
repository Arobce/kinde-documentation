To enable your design code to override Kinde page design, you need to set up and connect a git repo for the design files. You must also be using a [custom domain](/build/domains/pointing-your-domain/) to run your custom design code with Kinde.

1. Go to **Design > Custom code**.
2. Select the option to **Connect repo**. This will take you to the **Settings > Git Repo** page where you can manage your repo connection for design and workflows.
3. If you donâ€™t already have a repo set up for workflows, select **Connect GitHub**. 
4. Follow the prompts to choose a repo and branch. 
5. Once connected, choose if you want to **set synced code live immediately**. This is more efficient for dev and testing environments, but you might switch this off in your production environment.

### Set up the GitHub directory structure

Your directory structure should be in the format `pages/(kinde)/(<route>)/page.[ts/tsx]` where `<route>` is used to map your code to a rendered page in Kinde. For example `pages/(kinde)/(register)/page.tsx` will map to the register / sign up page in the auth flow. For more information see [About the Kinde widget and page](/design/design-with-code/kinde-widget-page/)
