Bindings allow your workflow code to interact with resources within the Kinde infrastructure.

When you declare a binding in your workflow, you grant it a specific capability, such as being able to access environment variables or add claims to an access token. For example:

```js
export const workflowSettings: WorkflowSettings = {
  bindings: {
    "kinde.env": {}
  },
  ...
};
```

If a binding is not declared and you try to use it in the workflow, you'll get a runtime error.
