<Aside type="upgrade">

This is an advanced feature that is only available on the [Kinde Plus or Scale plans](https://kinde.com/pricing/)

</Aside>

Kinde supports creating machine-to-machine (M2M) applications that are scoped to a specific organization. This lets you securely issue access tokens tied to an organization, ensuring that any automation or service calling your APIs is restricted to the correct customer context.

Global (unscoped) M2M applications are still supported for broader use cases, such as internal automation across multiple orgs.

## When to use an org-scoped M2M application

You should use an organization-scoped M2M app when:

- You are building automation that acts on behalf of a specific customer or tenant.
- You are deploying AI agents, bots, or backend services that must be restricted to a single organizationâ€™s data.
- You want to issue different tokens with separate scopes or permissions per organization.
- You need to simplify tenant isolation and avoid passing or validating org codes manually.

## How it works

1. Create an M2M application inside an organization in the Kinde dashboard.
2. Assign scopes that define what the app can access (e.g. `read:users`, `write:flags`).
3. Use the client credentials flow to request an access token using the generated `client_id` and `client_secret`.
4. Kinde returns a token with trusted claims about the organization and app.
5. The token can be used to interact with Kinde APIs on behalf of that organization.

Each org-scoped app is tightly bound to a single organization. Tokens issued from that app cannot be used across orgs.

## Token structure

An example tokens issued to an org-scoped M2M app may include the following claims:

```json
{
  "aud": ["https://api.foobar.com/v1/"],
  "azp": "12ce25d1109d4c66b0f469e47d33f8eb",
  "exp": 1751212288,
  "gty": ["client_credentials"],
  "iat": 1751125888,
  "iss": "https://example.kinde.com",
  "jti": "28a8d6a8-fe7c-4c90-84a6-1b3ccaaeabf2",
  "org_code": "org_1234567890",
  "scope": "read:users write:flags",
  "scp": ["read:users", "write:flags"],
  "v": "2"
}
```

These claims can be used by your backend services to authorize access to specific APIs or resources.

## Org-scoped vs global M2M applications

| Feature               | Global M2M app                     | Org-scoped M2M app             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Org context in token  | No                                 | Yes                            |
| Tenant data isolation | Manual                             | Enforced                       |
| Use case              | Admin scripts, internal automation | Per-tenant agents, scoped APIs |
| Token restrictions    | None                               | Scoped to one org              |
| Token claims          | Basic                              | Includes `org_code`, `scope`   |

## Create an org-scoped M2M app

1. In Kinde, go to **Organizations**, then view an organization.
2. Select **M2M apps**.
3. Select **Add M2M application**
4. Enter a name for the application
5. Select **Save**.

Kinde generates a `client_id` and `client_secret` tied to the selected organization.
Use the credentials in a standard client credentials flow to request a token.

## Best practices

- Use separate M2M apps for different scopes or services.
- Limit the [scopes](https://docs.kinde.com/developer-tools/your-apis/custom-api-scopes/) assigned to each M2M app to the minimum required for its function.
- [Rotate client secrets](https://docs.kinde.com/build/applications/rotate-client-secret/) periodically using the UI.
- Audit token usage by tracking `client_id` and `org_code` in logs.
- Avoid including any personally identifiable information (PII) in token claims.
