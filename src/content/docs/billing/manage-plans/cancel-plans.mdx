While we would rather they didn't customers are going to want to cancel their plan subscription (also known as an Agreement in Stripe).

- The customer can cancel via the self-serve portal
- You can cancel on behalf of a customer via API

<Aside>

  There is not currently a way to cancel via the Kinde UI

## How a customer can cancel their own plan

1. In your app or product, they open the self-serve portal for managing their account.
2. On the **Plan** page, they can scroll to the bottom and select **Cancel plan**.
3. They follow the prompts to cancel. This information is synced to Stripe. Depending on the [billing policies](/billing/manage-plans/upgrade-downgrade-plans/) you have set, they might receive a bill for unpaid usage, or be credited for unused subscription days.

## Cancel a plan via API

1. Get the customer's Agreement ID. This is the unique ID associated with their subscription in Stripe. You can find it in their Kinde record under Billing.
2. Using a DELETE request, hit the delete/api/v1/billing/agreements endpoint and include the `agreement_id` value in the call.

## Receive an alert when a customer cancels their plan

You can set up a workflow that enables you to check and approve cancellations. You might want to do this, for example, to be alerted when high value customers cancel.

For details, refer to the [Plan cancellation request workflow](/workflows/example-workflows/plan-cancellation-request-workflow/).
