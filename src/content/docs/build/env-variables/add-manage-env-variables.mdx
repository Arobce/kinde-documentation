Environment variables are for including sensitive information in your application code, using a key. You then update the variable's key-value to update the value wherever the key is referenced. You can store as many environment variables in Kinde as you want. 

## Recommendations for variables

- Choose a key name that helps you easily recognize what the variable is for.
- Use a consistent case, such as CamelCase, snake_case, kebab-case, etc.
- Sensitive key values are obscured for security, but they can still be copied.

## Add an environment variable

1. Go to **Settings > Data management > Env variables**.
2. Select **Add environment variable**.
3. In the dialog that opens, enter the **Key** and the **Value**.
4. Select if the key is **Sensitive**. 
5. Select **Save**.

## Update an environment variable value

You can only update the value of non-sensitive variables. If you need to update a sensitive variable value, you’ll need to delete and then create a new variable. 

1. Go to **Settings > Data management > Env variables**. A list of all your variables is shown.
2. Select **Edit variable** in the … three dots menu next to the relevant non-sensitive variable. The **Edit variable** dialog opens.  
3. Change the **Value**. You cannot change the `key`.
4. Select **Save**.

## Delete an environment variable

1. Go to **Settings > Data management > Env variables**. A list of all your variables is shown.
2. Select **Delete variable** in the … three dots menu next to the relevant variable. A confirmation window appears.
