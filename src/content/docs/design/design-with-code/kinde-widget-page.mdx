The Kinde widget is a core element in Kinde page design. The components that make up the widget have been specifically designed to be easily overridden by your own CSS so you can give it the look and feel of your brand whilst keeping best in class security.

Most styles can be switched out using our suite of [CSS custom properties](tbc) but for more complex customizations, we have provided style hooks that you can use to completely replace everything.

Before designing the elements of the widget and page, fully set up authentication and user access flow, as these impact what is shown in the widget.
