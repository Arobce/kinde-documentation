The pricing table that displayed in a particular flow depends on the the [default plan groups and group types](/billing/manage-plans/add-manage-plan-groups/).

## B2C (User-based)

A pricing table is shown when:

- A new user registers
- An existing user, marked as a billing customer, signs in but isnâ€™t on a plan yet

## B2B (Org-based)

A pricing table is shown when:

- A new organization registers (`is_create_org` parameter)
- An org member with `org:write:billing` permission signs in and the org is a billing customer but not on a plan yet

## B2B2C (Platforms - uses both)

- Organization plan selection = B2B logic
- User plan selection = B2C logic

## Override the default plan display

You can override which plan or pricing table is shown using URL parameters. See: [Update code and URLs for billing](/billing/billing-user-experience/add-billing-to-url-sdk/).
