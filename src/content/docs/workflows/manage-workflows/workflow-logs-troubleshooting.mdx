Things can go wrong with workflows, so we provide both sync logs and runtime logs to help you investigate the cause of issues. 

## View code sync log

When your code hits Kinde from a fresh commit in your repo, we check to make sure we’re able to run it. If these checks fail, this will show up in the sync logs. 

1. Go to **Settings > Git repo > Sync logs**. This shows a page list of all the sync events in chronological order.
2. Select the leftmost column or open the three dots menu next to an item in the list to view details of the sync. The **Sync event details** page opens.
3. Details of which processes succeeded and fails are shown. 

## Workflow runtime log

When your code is running in a workflow, we monitor performance and activity as the workflow executes. If you discover or someone reports an issue with the workflow, runtime logs are likely to pick up any errors.

A successful log might look like this:

```jsx
🚀 User tokens generation trigger fired
🔍 Workflow found
⚙️ JavaScript execution started…
ℹ️ INF "logging from action" {"hello": "world"}
🎉 Workflow completed in 1.1ms
```

## Troubleshooting code sync and workflows

- Use console.log to print out any values that will assist debugging, these will be shown in the **Sync log**.
