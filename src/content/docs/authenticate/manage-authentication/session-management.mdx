You can manage Kinde authenticated sessions via your application settings. An authenticated session (or SSO session) is the time during which a user is authenticated via Kinde, regardless of their activity. You can define if a session persists even after a browser is closed, and how long can lapse before making a user re-authenticate.

## Manage SSO session behaviors and policies

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Applications.**
2. Select **View details** on the application tile.
3. Select **Sessions** in the side menu.
4. In the **SSO sessions** section, decide on the policy for session cookies. This determines if a session stays open or closes when a user closes the browser.
5. In the **Session inactivity timeout** section, set how long a session can be inactive before prompting re-authentication. This setting is applied in seconds - where 3,600 seconds is one hour; 86,400 seconds is one day.
6. When you're finished, select **Save**.
