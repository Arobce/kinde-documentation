# Signing Up a Customer to a Plan

When signing up a customer to a plan, you have three main options depending on how much control you want over the experience:

---

## Option 1: Use Your Own Plan Selection Screen

Display a plan selection screen in your own app or website. Once the user selects a plan, redirect them to Kinde to complete the payment flow.
To pre-select a plan, pass the `plan_interest` query parameter in the Kinde authentication URL.

---

## Option 2: Use Kinde’s Built-in Plan Selection

Let Kinde handle plan selection as part of the authentication flow.
To enable this:

- Create a **Pricing Table** in Kinde
- Add and publish your plans
- Set the table to **Live**

Kinde will then display the plan selection screen during signup.

---

## Option 3: Assign a Plan via the Management API

Use the Kinde Management API to assign a customer to a specific plan.
The next time the customer signs in, Kinde will automatically prompt them for payment details.

This is ideal for:

- Migrating customers from another system
- Assigning a plan without user input

---

## Authentication Flow Screens

Depending on the option you choose, users will see different screens during the authentication flow. There are three customizable screens:

1. **Plan Selection**
   Displayed when a user signs up for the first time and multiple plans are available.

2. **Payment Details**
   Shown after a user selects a plan—or if a plan was pre-selected before redirecting to Kinde.

3. **Success**
   Shown when signup and payment are successfully completed.

---

## Customizing the Experience

By default, all screens will inherit branding and styling from your Kinde [Design](/design/brand/global-brand-defaults/) settings.

If you want more control, you can fully customize these screens using your own **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with the [Kinde Custom UI feature](/design/customize-with-code/customize-with-css-html/).
