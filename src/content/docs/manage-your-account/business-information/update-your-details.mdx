You can change some business details in Kinde, but you may need to contact support for help with other changes.

## Change your sign in name

1. In Kinde, go to the bottom-left of screen and select your avatar.
2. In the menu that opens, select **Account details**.
3. Make the changes you want and select **Save**.

## Change the email you sign in to Kinde with

You cannot edit the email you sign in to Kinde with, but you can invite a new team member (new email) to join you on Kinde and make them an Owner in the business. 

1. Send a [team invitation](/get-started/team-and-account/add-team-members/) to the new email address.
2. Accept the invitation to join Kinde.
3. (If applicable) Contact support@kinde.com (from the original Owner email) and request that the new team member be promoted to the role of Owner.
4. (If applicable) Once that is done, you can request via support@kinde.com that the original Owner (Old email) be deleted from your business. Owners cannot delete other Owners.

## Change business details

1. In Kinde, go to **Settings > Business > Details.**
2. If you want to change your business name, this will not impact your kinde business URL that was already created.
3. Update your primary email and phone. Note that changing the email here does not impact team sign in. If you need to update your Kinde sign-in email, see the procedure above.
4. Make any other changes and select **Save**.
