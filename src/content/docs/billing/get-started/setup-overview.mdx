Billing is big step for a business, so it’s a good idea to review the process before you start.

## Overview of billing setup

1. [Set up billing roles and permissions (B2B)](/billing/get-started/add-billing-role/)
2. [Set currency](/billing/get-started/default-billing-currency/) - you can’t change this once your first plan is published
3. [Connect to Stripe](/billing/get-started/connect-to-stripe/)
4. [Build plans](/billing/manage-plans/create-plans/)
5. [Publish plans](/billing/get-started/publish-plans/)
6. Enable subscription self-serve (optional)
    1. [Create a plan selector](/billing/billing-user-experience/plan-selection/)
    2. [Enable self-serve portal](/build/set-up-options/self-serve-portal-for-orgs/)
7. Update your code
8. Test the setup and get your first subscriber!

## ⚠️ Test in a non-production environment

If you are using billing for the first time, make sure you use a Kinde non-production environment to test out the billing features. 

When you use a non-production environment, Stripe automatically creates a test Stripe environment. This test environment allows you to create customers and billing subscriptions without actually charging customers. You can also use Stripe’s test credit card details.

## Before setting up billing

- Make a list of all your app’s features - with names, descriptions, prices, metered rates, limits, inclusions, etc. You might consider doing this in a spreadsheet to make it easier and faster to add features in the Kinde plan builder. Include plan variations for prices, limits, etc.

- (B2B) make sure your Kinde business is set up to [create an organization on sign up](https://docs.kinde.com/build/organizations/orgs-for-developers/#new-organization-self-sign-up).

Follow the numbered steps in this section to set up billing in your business.

## Set billing policies for cancellation and plan changes

You can also set policies to control what happens when a customer cancels or changes their plan. The policies are for deciding if you charge or forgive unpaid usage of metered features, or if you refund of retain unused, paid subscription days. 

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Billing** to set these policy defaults.
2. In the **Policies** section, choose the settings.
