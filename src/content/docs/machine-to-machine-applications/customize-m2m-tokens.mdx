You can customize the claims of tokens issued to machine-to-machine (M2M) applications in Kinde by including selected **Properties** and **Feature Flags**. This allows you to inject structured metadata and configuration directly into the token, without requiring an additional lookup at runtime.

This is useful for:
- Routing or behavior changes based on metadata
- Feature gating in backend systems
- Configuring AI agents or other automation tools

## Where to configure token customization

1. Go to your M2M application in Kinde
2. Select the **Tokens** tab

From here you can:
- Set the token lifetime
- Enable **Hasura-compatible mapping**
- Opt to include scopes under a `permissions` claim
- Toggle on **Properties** and **Feature flags** to be included in the token

Tokens remain signed JWTs and can be verified like any other Kinde-issued token.

## Include properties in the token

**Properties** are a flexible metadata system in Kinde. You can define custom fields and assign values to individual M2M applications — for example, `tier`, `region`, or `model_version`.

To include a property in the token:

1. First, assign the property value to the M2M app (see [Add metadata to an M2M application](/build/applications/m2m-properties/))
2. Then, in the **Tokens** tab, toggle that property on

The value will appear in the token under a `application_properties` claim:

```json
{
"application_properties": {
    "region": {
      "v": "eu"
    },
    "tier": {
      "v": "pro"
    }
  }
}
```

The `v` is a shortcode for the value of the property.

Only the properties you explicitly toggle on will be included.

## Include feature flags in the token

If your M2M app is scoped to an organization, you can also include feature flags that are enabled for that org.

To do this:

1. In the **Tokens** tab of the M2M app, toggle on any feature flags you want to include
2. These flags will appear in the token under a `feature_flags` claim

Example:

```json
{
  "feature_flags": {
      "new-ai-agent": {
          "t": "b",
          "v": true
       },
  	   "access-level": {
          "t": "s",
          "v": "beta"
       }
    }
}
```
The `t` and `v` are short codes for the type and value of the feature flag.

- `t` = `type` (boolean, string, number)
- `v` = `value` (true | false, "beta", 1, etc.)

Only the feature flags you explicitly toggle on will be included.

## Notes

- Properties must be defined and assigned before they can be included in a token
- Only environment level feature flags are available for M2M apps
- Only toggled flags and properties are included — the token stays lean and secure

## Complete control over the token

For complete control over the token, you can use the Kinde M2M token generation workflow to customize the token further.

For example, you can:
- Add custom claims to the token
- Add custom scopes to the token
- Add custom metadata to the token
