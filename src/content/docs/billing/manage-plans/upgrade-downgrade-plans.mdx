If you offer different levels of paid plans, then you will need to facilitate plan upgrade or downgrade. Before you make plan changes, make sure you have set the policies. 

## Set billing policies for cancellation and plan changes

You can also set policies to control what happens when a customer cancels or changes their plan. The policies are for deciding if you charge or forgive unpaid usage of metered features, and if you refund of retain unused, paid subscription days. 

By default, unpaid usage is forgiven and you don't refund or credit for unused subscription days.

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Billing** to set these policy defaults.
2. In the **Policies** section, choose the settings.

3. Select **Save**.

## Ways you can change plans

- Allow business customers to manage their plans via the [self-serve portal](/build/set-up-options/self-serve-portal-for-orgs/) if there's a [pricing table](/billing/billing-user-experience/plan-selection/).
- Manually upgrade or downgrade via the Kinde UI (see below)
- Programmatically upgrade or downgrade via API

## Upgrade a plan for an organization (B2B) or user (B2C)

1. Open the organization or user record in Kinde.
   - Go to **Orgnizations** and locate the org.
   - Go to **Users** and locate the user. 
2. Select **Billing** in the side menu. Details of the org's or user's plan are shown.
3. Select **Change plan**.
4. In the dialog that appears, select the new plan.
5. Select **Save**. The customer's plan is now updated.

Depending on the billing policies you have set (above), this information will be synced to Stripe and an invoice credit or bill will be issued.
