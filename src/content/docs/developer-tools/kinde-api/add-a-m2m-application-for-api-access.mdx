Machine to machine applications facilitate token exchange between systems, applications, and services, including micro-services.

For example, you need a machine to machine application for connecting to [Kinde’s Management API](https://kinde.com/api/docs/#kinde-management-api). See below for instructions.

## About scopes and the Kinde Management API

Scopes must be defined in all applications you want to access the Kinde Management API. You can select scopes when you authorize a new application or you can add scopes to an existing application. See the relevant procedure below.

## Step 1: Add a machine to machine application

1. Go to **Settings > Applications.**
2. Select **Add Application**.
3. In the dialog that opens, give the application a name, and select **Machine to Machine** as the **Application type**.
4. Select **Save**. App keys - including **Domain** details, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** - are issued for the application. Use these details to set up the connection to your application or service.

## Step 2: Authorize the application and select scopes

1. Select **View details** on the M2M application tile. 
2. On the left, select **APIs**.
3. Select the three dots next to the Kinde management API, then choose **Authorize application**.
4. Select the three dots next to the Kinde management API, then choose **Manage scopes**. 
5. Select the scopes you want to include in the token. For maximum security only enable the minimum scopes you require. 
6. Select **Save**
7. Next: [Get an access token for Kinde’s management API](/developer-tools/kinde-api/get-access-token-for-connecting-securely-to-kindes-api/).

## Change or add scopes to an application accessing the Kinde Management API

Follow this procedure if you already have an application and you experience a scope error or want to add scopes to an application.

1. Go to **Settings > Applications** and select your application.
2. On the left, select **APIs**.
3. Select the three dots next to the Kinde management API, then choose **Manage scopes**. 
4. Select the scopes you want to include in the token. For maximum security only enable the minimum scopes you require. 
5. Select **Save**

## How M2M tokens are calculated in Kinde

An M2M token is generated each time you call the `/oauth2/token` Kinde API endpoint to retrieve an M2M access token.

Where an access token is re-used - say where the same token is used to make another API request, this does not count as a new token. Similarly, where a token is re-used to make calls to other Kinde-registered APIs, this is also not counted as another token.

Kinde’s free and Pro plans have a generous amount of M2M tokens included, before we start charging for them. For details, see our [pricing page](https://kinde.com/pricing/).
