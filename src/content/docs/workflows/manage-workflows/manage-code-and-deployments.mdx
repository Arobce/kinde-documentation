Workflows in Kinde let you execute your own code and actions when a trigger event happens in Kinde. 

When your code gets updated, you need to update your workflows. 

## Sync code from your repo

Get the latest code from your repo so that you can it can be checked for deployment-readiness. The result of a sync will tell you if the code is ready.

1. Go to **Workflows**.
2. In the display area for your repo connections, select **Sync** **code**. On the **Summary** page, the latest deployment will show.

## Make a deployment live

Typically, you will make the latest code deployment live, so it is used in the workflow. But you can make any deployment live.

1. Go to **Workflows**.
2. Refresh code from your repo by selecting **Get latest code**.
3. Select the workflow you want to update.
4. On the **Workflow** page, select **Make live** from the deployment context menu. The workflow will update to use the latest code.

## View all deployments

1. Go to **Workflows**. 
2. Select the workflow to view the details.
3. Select **Deployments** in the menu. A list of all your deployments shows. See below to interpret deployment statuses.
