You can test a workflow by testing one of the code deployments.

For this you need to get the Workflow deployment ID and password from Kinde. 

## Copy testing details from Kinde

We recommend you always test your code to stage a workflow, before you make it live. 

1. Go to **Workflows**.
2. Select a workflow in the list to open it. The **Workflow** details page opens. 
3. Select **Deployments** in the menu. A list of all your deployments shows.
4. Select the deployment you want to test. The **Deployment details** page opens. 
5. Scroll to the bottom of the page and copy the workflow deployment ID and password that you need for testing.
6. Copy these and apply them in your application. Use them when you test the workflow.
