You can configure a self-serve portal to enable authorized organization members to be able to self-manage functions provided by Kinde. For example, you can allow them to update their business details, payment details (if you have billing set up), multi-factor auth settings, and team members.

A self-serve portal means your customers can make basic account changes without contacting you for support. This can save time and money.

## Configure the self-serve portal

1. Go to **Settings > Environment > Self-serve portal**.
2. Enter the **Return URL** that you want users to land on when they exit the portal, e.g. your app dashboard.
3. Add an **Organization alias** to represent how your customers are referred to in your business, e.g. Account, Partner, Workspace, etc. This will be visible in the interface in the portal.
4. In the **Organization profile** section, select the functions you want organization admins to be able to manage.
5. Select **Save**.

## Give an organization access to the portal
